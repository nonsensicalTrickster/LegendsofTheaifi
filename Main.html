    <p>The world around you, Theaifi, is a richly magical world with several ruling powers, the Elven kingdoms in the East, the Orcish democracy in the West, the Tabaxi alliance in the South, and the Northern Frost Giants, who go without a true leader and are assumed to live clan-like lives. The land is peaceful after a one-hundred and seventy year war that took place millennia ago, and while there are treaties and truces, everyone knows that things could crumple if even one of those treaties were broken.</p>
    <p>Legend states that in the beginning, the various nations of Theaifi were as one with a sovereign deity overseeing the lives of sentient beings that populated the world. Aeons came and went, but as all things must, peace came to an end. Records about the legend are obfuscated in regards to who or what was responsible, but the deity was slain and broken into 11 pieces. Those 11 pieces took on a form of life of their own, and slowly populated the land with more of their ilk. As time went on, the offspring of the 11 pieces began to bicker and argue... and soon divides in the land were formed and feuds began. These offspring would later go on to produce their own offspring, and thus, the first mortals were born.</p>
